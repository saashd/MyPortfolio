# My Web Portfolio

This is a personal web portfolio, showcasing my skills and projects. 
The site was built using React, including React Hooks and React Router to maintain a single-page application. 
Material UI was used for styling, and EmailJS was integrated for the contact form.

The project was bootstrapped with Create React App and deployed using Netlify. You can check out the live site [here](https://alexdruzina.com).
